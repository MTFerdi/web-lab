Dark Theme Toggle Feature
This project includes a dark theme toggle that allows users to switch between light and dark modes.

âœ¨ How It Works
A button located in the <header> toggles a data-theme attribute on the <body> element.

When the button is clicked, JavaScript flips the data-theme between "light" and "dark".

CSS styles for both themes are applied conditionally based on the data-theme attribute using attribute selectors.

Transitions are animated smoothly for a better user experience.

ðŸ›  Technologies Used
